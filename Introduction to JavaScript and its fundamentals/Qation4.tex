
In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. They allow developers to store values such as numbers, 
strings, objects, or functions, and reference them throughout their code.

The let keyword is one of the modern ways to declare variables in JavaScript. It was introduced in ECMAScript 6  and provides 
block-scoping, which means variables declared with let are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression in which they are 
defined. This helps to prevent unintended variable hoisting and scope-related bugs
